Hey everyone! This is a project of mine called CharityConnect that matches users to one out of roughly 50 charities worldwide, providing the charity's name, blurb, and link. It also features a general catalogue of all of the charities. It was started to encourage donations for causes my friends and I care about, but I coded it independently. Enjoy trying it out at https://charityconnect-457700.wn.r.appspot.com/
