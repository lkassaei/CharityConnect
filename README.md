Hey everyone! My project, called CharityConnect, is a user-friendly, AI-powered quiz that helps users discover and connect with one charity out of roughly fifty worldwide options. After answering questions about their interests—for example, the type of relief they want to support or the regions of the world they care most about—the quiz matches them with a charity and provides its name, a short description, and a direct link. The site also features a full catalogue of all the charities for users who want to explore further.

I originally created this project for my friends to encourage donations to causes we care about, and I’ve continued expanding it since. To get technical, the quiz itself is powered by a Llama AI API key, which processes user input and matches responses to the most relevant charity in a file with all the charity information. This was all done on VSCode. Through this project, I struggled with parsing the AI's response into a readable sentence instead of its raw, cryptic response. Through my immense struggle with this, I learned the power of patience in debugging, and how useful GitHub commits are to be able to restore previous code.
